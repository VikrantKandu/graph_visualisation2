architecture_best_practices:
- best_practice: Use VPC Flow Logs
  description: Enable VPC Flow Logs to capture information about the IP traffic going
    to and from network interfaces in your VPC. This helps in monitoring and troubleshooting
    network connectivity issues.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Multi-AZ Deployment
  description: Deploy Network Insights components across multiple Availability Zones
    to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Use Elastic Load Balancing
  description: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances,
    to ensure no single instance becomes a bottleneck.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable Auto Scaling
  description: Configure Auto Scaling to automatically adjust the number of instances
    based on traffic patterns, ensuring optimal performance and cost-efficiency.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Utilize AWS CloudFormation for Infrastructure as Code
  description: Use AWS CloudFormation to manage and provision your Network Insights
    infrastructure in a consistent and repeatable manner.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Regularly Review and Optimize Network Architecture
  description: Periodically review your network architecture to ensure it meets current
    requirements and optimize for performance and cost.
  severity: Medium
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Enable AWS Config
  description: Use AWS Config to continuously monitor and record your AWS resource
    configurations and help ensure compliance with internal policies and best practices.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement IAM Policies and Roles
  description: Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to define granular permissions
    and roles, ensuring that users and services have the minimum necessary access.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Enable Encryption for Data in Transit and at Rest
  description: Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to encrypt sensitive data both
    in transit and at rest to protect against unauthorized access.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Regularly Rotate IAM Credentials
  description: Rotate IAM credentials, including access keys and passwords, on a regular
    basis to minimize the risk of compromised credentials.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable Logging and Monitoring
  description: Use AWS CloudTrail and Amazon CloudWatch to log and monitor all API
    calls and network activity for auditing and anomaly detection.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Network Segmentation
  description: Use security groups and network ACLs to segment your network, limiting
    the blast radius in case of a security breach.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Conduct Regular Security Audits
  description: Perform regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify
    and mitigate potential security risks.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use AWS Shield and AWS WAF
  description: Protect your applications from DDoS attacks and other web exploits
    by using AWS Shield and AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF).
  severity: High
