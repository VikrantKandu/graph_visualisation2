  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Enable Data Compression
  description: Enable data compression to reduce the amount of data transferred over
    the network, improving efficiency and reducing costs.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use IAM Roles for Task Execution
  description: Assign specific IAM roles to DataSync tasks to ensure that only the
    necessary permissions are granted, following the principle of least privilege.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Data Validation
  description: Use DataSync's built-in data validation features to ensure data integrity
    during transfer.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Plan for Disaster Recovery
  description: Incorporate DataSync into your disaster recovery plan to ensure data
    is backed up and can be restored quickly in the event of a failure.
  severity: Critical
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Encrypt Data in Transit
  description: Use TLS to encrypt data in transit between DataSync agents and AWS
    services to protect against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Encrypt Data at Rest
  description: Ensure that data is encrypted at rest using AWS Key Management Service
    (KMS) to protect against unauthorized access.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Use Least Privilege Access
  description: Follow the principle of least privilege by granting DataSync tasks
    only the permissions they need to perform their functions.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Regularly Rotate Credentials
  description: Regularly rotate IAM credentials and access keys used by DataSync to
    minimize the risk of compromised credentials.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable Logging and Monitoring
  description: Enable AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch Logs to monitor DataSync activities
    and detect any unauthorized or suspicious actions.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Network Security Controls

    traffic to DataSync agents and endpoints.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Conduct Regular Security Audits
  description: Regularly audit DataSync configurations and permissions to ensure compliance
    with security policies and best practices.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
  description: Require MFA for IAM users and roles that have access to DataSync to
    add an extra layer of security.
  severity: Medium
