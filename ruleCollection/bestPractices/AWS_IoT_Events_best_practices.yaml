    system by leveraging AWS cost management tools.
  severity: Medium
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Least Privilege Principle
  description: Apply the principle of least privilege to IAM roles and policies, ensuring
    that components only have the permissions they need.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Encryption of Data in Transit and at Rest
  description: Ensure that all data transmitted between devices and AWS IoT Events
    is encrypted, as well as data stored in AWS services.
  severity: Critical
