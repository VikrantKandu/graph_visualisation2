    Availability Zones to enhance fault tolerance and availability.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Enable Automated Backups
  description: Configure automated backups to ensure that your data is regularly backed
    up and can be restored in case of failure.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Optimize Database Performance
  description: Regularly monitor and tune your database performance by adjusting parameters,
    using appropriate instance types, and leveraging read replicas.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Database Caching
  description: Use caching mechanisms like Amazon ElastiCache to reduce database load
    and improve application performance.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Appropriate Instance Types
  description: Select the instance types that best match your workload requirements
    to ensure optimal performance and cost-efficiency.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Monitor and Scale Resources
  description: Continuously monitor resource usage and scale your RDS instances as
    needed to handle varying workloads.
  severity: Medium

    continuity in case of unexpected failures.
  severity: Critical
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Enable IAM Authentication
  description: Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage access to your
    Amazon RDS instances, ensuring that only authorized users can access your databases.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Configure Security Groups
  description: Set up security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to your
    RDS instances, limiting access to only trusted sources.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Regularly Update Database Software
  description: Keep your database software up to date with the latest patches and
    updates to protect against known vulnerabilities.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable Database Activity Streams
  description: Use Database Activity Streams to monitor and audit database activity,
    helping to detect and respond to potential security threats.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use AWS Secrets Manager
  description: Store and manage database credentials securely using AWS Secrets Manager,
    reducing the risk of credential exposure.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Network Encryption
  description: Use SSL/TLS to encrypt data in transit between your application and
    RDS instances to protect against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Regularly Review Access Logs
  description: Regularly review database access logs to detect and respond to unauthorized
    access attempts.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
