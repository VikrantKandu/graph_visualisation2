  description: Deploying your AWS RDS instances across multiple availability zones
    ensures high availability and fault tolerance.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Enable Automated Backups
  description: Automated backups help in data recovery and ensure that you can restore
    your database to a specific point in time.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Optimize Instance Types
  description: Choose the right instance type based on your workload requirements
    to optimize cost and performance.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Implement Read Replicas
  description: Use read replicas to offload read traffic and improve the performance
    of your primary database.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
  description: Implement ELB to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances
    for improved scalability and fault tolerance.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable Performance Insights
  description: Use Performance Insights to monitor and optimize the performance of
    your RDS instances.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Apply Appropriate Storage Types
  description: Use General Purpose SSD (gp2) or Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) based on
    your performance requirements.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Implement Database Caching
  description: Use caching mechanisms like Amazon ElastiCache to reduce the load on
    your RDS instances and improve performance.
  severity: Medium
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Enable Encryption at Rest
  description: Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to encrypt your RDS data at rest
    to protect sensitive information.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Enable Encryption in Transit
  description: Use SSL/TLS to encrypt data in transit between your application and
    RDS instances to prevent data interception.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Implement IAM Roles
  description: Use IAM roles to manage permissions and access controls for your RDS
    instances, ensuring least privilege access.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
  description: Require MFA for accessing the AWS Management Console to add an extra
    layer of security.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Regularly Rotate Credentials
  description: Rotate database credentials and IAM keys regularly to minimize the
    risk of credential compromise.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Security Groups
  description: Configure security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to
    your RDS instances, allowing only necessary traffic.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable Audit Logging
  description: Enable database audit logging to track access and modifications to
    your RDS instances for compliance and security monitoring.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Apply Patches and Updates
  description: Regularly apply patches and updates to your RDS instances to protect
    against known vulnerabilities.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Monitor with CloudWatch
  description: Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor your RDS instances for unusual activity
    and performance metrics.
  severity: Medium
