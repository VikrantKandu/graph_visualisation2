architecture_best_practices:
- best_practice: Use Lifecycle Policies
  description: Implement lifecycle policies to automatically transition data to Amazon
    S3 Glacier or delete it after a specified period. This helps in managing storage
    costs and ensures data is archived appropriately.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Optimize Data Retrieval
  description: Plan and optimize data retrieval strategies to minimize costs and retrieval
    times. Use bulk retrieval for large datasets and expedited retrieval for urgent
    access.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Multipart Upload
  description: For large archives, use multipart upload to improve upload reliability
    and performance. This ensures data integrity and reduces the risk of failed uploads.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Monitor Storage Usage
  description: Regularly monitor storage usage and retrieval activities using AWS
    CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail. This helps in identifying unusual patterns and
    managing costs effectively.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Plan for Data Retrieval Costs
  description: Understand and plan for the costs associated with data retrieval from
    Amazon S3 Glacier. This includes considering the frequency and urgency of data
    access.
  severity: High
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Enable Encryption
  description: Ensure all data stored in Amazon S3 Glacier is encrypted using AWS
    Key Management Service (KMS) or client-side encryption. This protects data at
    rest from unauthorized access.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Implement IAM Policies
  description: Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to control access
    to Amazon S3 Glacier. Grant the least privilege necessary to perform required
    tasks.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Enable MFA Delete
  description: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Delete on S3 buckets to add
    an extra layer of security for delete operations, preventing accidental or malicious
    data deletion.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use VPC Endpoints
  description: Use VPC endpoints to securely connect to Amazon S3 Glacier without
    traversing the public internet, reducing exposure to potential threats.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Monitor and Audit Access
  description: Use AWS CloudTrail to log and monitor all access to Amazon S3 Glacier.
    Regularly review audit logs to detect and respond to unauthorized access attempts.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Data Integrity Checks
  description: Use checksums to verify data integrity during upload and retrieval
    processes. This ensures that data has not been corrupted or tampered with.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Regularly Update IAM Roles and Policies
  description: Regularly review and update IAM roles and policies to ensure they comply
    with the principle of least privilege and reflect current organizational needs.
  severity: Medium
