architecture_best_practices:
  - best_practice: Use Managed Scaling
    description: Utilize Amazon EMR managed scaling to automatically adjust the number of instances in your cluster for optimal performance and cost-efficiency.
    severity: Medium
  - best_practice: Optimize Instance Types
    description: Select appropriate instance types based on workload requirements to balance cost and performance.
    severity: High
  - best_practice: Enable Auto Termination
    description: Configure clusters to automatically terminate after job completion to avoid unnecessary costs.
    severity: Medium
  - best_practice: Use Spot Instances
    description: Leverage Spot Instances for cost savings, but ensure that your workloads can handle interruptions.
    severity: Medium
  - best_practice: Data Locality
    description: Ensure that data is stored in the same region as your Amazon EMR cluster to minimize latency and data transfer costs.
    severity: High
  - best_practice: Monitor and Tune Performance
    description: Regularly monitor cluster performance and adjust configurations to optimize resource utilization and job performance.
    severity: Medium
  - best_practice: Use Amazon S3 for Storage
    description: Store input and output data in Amazon S3 for scalability and durability.
    severity: Medium
  - best_practice: Leverage EMRFS Consistency View
    description: Use EMRFS Consistency View to ensure data consistency between Amazon S3 and Amazon EMR.
    severity: Low

security_best_practices:
  - best_practice: Enable Encryption
    description: Use encryption at rest and in transit to protect sensitive data.
    severity: Critical
  - best_practice: Use IAM Roles
    description: Assign least-privilege IAM roles to your Amazon EMR clusters to control access to AWS resources.
    severity: High
  - best_practice: Enable Logging
    description: Enable logging for Amazon EMR to capture detailed information about cluster activity and job execution.
    severity: Medium
  - best_practice: Configure Security Groups
    description: Use security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to your Amazon EMR clusters.
    severity: High
  - best_practice: Regularly Rotate Credentials
    description: Regularly rotate IAM credentials and access keys to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.
    severity: High
  - best_practice: Use VPC Endpoints
    description: Use VPC endpoints to securely connect your Amazon EMR clusters to other AWS services without traversing the public internet.
    severity: Medium
  - best_practice: Enable Kerberos Authentication
    description: Use Kerberos authentication for enhanced security in multi-tenant environments.
    severity: Medium
  - best_practice: Implement Network Isolation
    description: Use private subnets and network ACLs to isolate your Amazon EMR clusters from other network traffic.
    severity: High
