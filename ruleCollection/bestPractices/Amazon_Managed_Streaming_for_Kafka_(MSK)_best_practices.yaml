architecture_best_practices:
- best_practice: Proper Sizing of Kafka Clusters
  description: Ensure that Kafka clusters are appropriately sized based on the anticipated
    load and throughput requirements to avoid performance bottlenecks.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Multi-AZ Deployments
  description: Deploy Kafka clusters across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) to ensure
    high availability and fault tolerance.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Optimize Topic Partitioning
  description: Properly partition Kafka topics to balance load across brokers and
    improve parallelism and throughput.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Monitor and Scale Dynamically
  description: Implement monitoring and auto-scaling to adapt to changing workloads
    and maintain optimal performance.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Dedicated Subnets
  description: Deploy Kafka clusters in dedicated subnets to isolate them from other
    services and reduce network congestion.
  severity: Medium
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Enable Encryption in Transit
  description: Use TLS to encrypt data in transit between clients and Kafka brokers
    to prevent interception and unauthorized access.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Enable Encryption at Rest
  description: Enable encryption for data stored on Kafka brokers to protect sensitive
    information from unauthorized access.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement IAM Policies
  description: Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to control access
    to Kafka resources and limit permissions to the minimum necessary.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use VPC Peering or PrivateLink
  description: Use VPC peering or AWS PrivateLink to securely connect Kafka clients
    to brokers without exposing traffic to the public internet.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Regularly Rotate Credentials
  description: Regularly rotate AWS credentials and Kafka client secrets to minimize
    the risk of credential compromise.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Enable Logging and Auditing
  description: Enable logging and auditing of Kafka operations to detect and respond
    to security incidents promptly.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Network Access Controls
  description: Use security groups and network ACLs to restrict access to Kafka brokers
    to only trusted sources.
  severity: High
