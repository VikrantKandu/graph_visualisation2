architecture_best_practices:
- best_practice: Proper Shard Allocation
  description: Ensure that you allocate an appropriate number of shards based on the
    expected data throughput to avoid bottlenecks and ensure smooth data processing.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Enhanced Fan-Out
  description: Utilize Enhanced Fan-Out for high-throughput applications to allow
    multiple consumers to read from the stream simultaneously without affecting each
    other.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Monitor and Scale Dynamically
  description: Implement monitoring and auto-scaling mechanisms to adjust the number
    of shards dynamically based on real-time data traffic.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Optimize Data Retention Period
  description: Set an appropriate data retention period based on your use case to
    balance between cost and data availability.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Partition Keys Effectively
  description: Design your partition keys to ensure an even distribution of data across
    shards, preventing hot shards and improving performance.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Leverage Kinesis Producer Library (KPL)
  description: Use the Kinesis Producer Library to efficiently batch and aggregate
    records before sending them to the stream, reducing costs and improving throughput.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Implement Error Handling and Retries
  description: Design your producer and consumer applications to handle errors and
    implement retry mechanisms to ensure data integrity and availability.
  severity: High
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Enable Server-Side Encryption
  description: Use server-side encryption to protect data at rest in your Kinesis
    Data Streams, ensuring that sensitive data is encrypted.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Use IAM Roles and Policies
  description: Implement fine-grained IAM roles and policies to control access to
    your Kinesis Data Streams, ensuring that only authorized entities can access or
    modify the data.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Enable VPC Endpoints
  description: Use VPC endpoints to securely connect your VPC to Kinesis Data Streams,
    ensuring that data does not traverse the public internet.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Monitor with CloudWatch
  description: Set up CloudWatch alarms and logs to monitor the health and activity
    of your Kinesis Data Streams, enabling you to detect and respond to security incidents
    promptly.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable Data Encryption in Transit
  description: Ensure that data is encrypted in transit using TLS to protect it from
    interception and tampering.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Regularly Rotate Access Keys
  description: Regularly rotate access keys for users and applications that interact
    with Kinesis Data Streams to minimize the risk of compromised credentials.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Least Privilege Principle
  description: Grant the minimum permissions necessary for users and applications
    to interact with Kinesis Data Streams, reducing the potential impact of a security
    breach.
  severity: High
