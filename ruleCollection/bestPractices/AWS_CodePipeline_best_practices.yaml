architecture_best_practices:
- best_practice: Use Modular Pipelines
  description: Break down the pipeline into smaller, reusable components to enhance
    maintainability and scalability.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Implement Parallel Stages
  description: Utilize parallel stages to improve the efficiency and speed of your
    pipeline by running independent tasks concurrently.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Managed Services
  description: Leverage AWS managed services like CodeBuild and CodeDeploy to reduce
    operational overhead and ensure high availability.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable Cross-Region Replication
  description: Set up cross-region replication to enhance the resilience and availability
    of your pipeline in case of regional failures.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Integrate with CloudWatch
  description: Use Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and logging to gain insights into
    pipeline performance and troubleshoot issues.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Optimize Resource Allocation
  description: Allocate appropriate resources to different stages to avoid bottlenecks
    and ensure efficient execution of the pipeline.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Version Control
  description: Ensure all pipeline definitions and configurations are stored in version
    control to track changes and facilitate rollback if needed.
  severity: High
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Implement Least Privilege Access
  description: Grant the minimum permissions necessary for users and services to perform
    their tasks to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Enable Encryption
  description: Use encryption for data at rest and in transit to protect sensitive
    information from unauthorized access.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Use IAM Roles
  description: Utilize IAM roles instead of long-term credentials to enhance security
    and manage permissions more effectively.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
  description: Require MFA for accessing the AWS Management Console to add an extra
    layer of security.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Regularly Rotate Credentials
  description: Rotate access keys and other credentials periodically to minimize the
    risk of compromised credentials.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Monitor and Audit Pipeline Activities
  description: Use AWS CloudTrail to log and monitor all pipeline activities for compliance
    and to detect any suspicious behavior.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Security Testing
  description: Integrate security testing tools into the pipeline to identify and
    mitigate vulnerabilities early in the development process.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Secure Artifact Storage
  description: Store build artifacts in secure, access-controlled locations such as
    S3 buckets with proper permissions.
  severity: High
