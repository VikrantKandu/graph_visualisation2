architecture_best_practices:
- best_practice: Enable Auto Scaling for High Availability
  description: Ensure that Auto Scaling is configured to maintain application availability
    by distributing traffic across multiple instances and Availability Zones.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Use Predictive Scaling
  description: Implement predictive scaling to anticipate traffic patterns and scale
    resources in advance, improving performance and cost-efficiency.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Define Appropriate Scaling Policies
  description: Create scaling policies that align with your application's performance
    requirements and workload patterns to optimize resource usage.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Monitor and Adjust Scaling Policies
  description: Regularly review and adjust scaling policies based on monitoring data
    to ensure they remain effective in meeting application demands.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Multiple Metrics for Scaling Decisions
  description: Utilize multiple metrics (e.g., CPU utilization, memory usage, request
    count) to make more informed scaling decisions and avoid over/under-provisioning.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Implement Graceful Scaling
  description: Ensure that your application can handle scaling events gracefully,
    such as by using connection draining and health checks.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Optimize Instance Types
  description: Select appropriate instance types for your Auto Scaling groups based
    on workload characteristics to balance cost and performance.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Automate Scaling with Infrastructure as Code
  description: Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like AWS CloudFormation or Terraform
    to automate the setup and management of Auto Scaling configurations.
  severity: Low
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Implement Least Privilege for IAM Roles
  description: Assign the minimum necessary permissions to IAM roles used by Auto
    Scaling to reduce the risk of unauthorized access or actions.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Enable Logging and Monitoring
  description: Enable logging and monitoring for Auto Scaling activities using AWS
    CloudTrail and Amazon CloudWatch to detect and respond to security incidents.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Secure Communication Channels
  description: Ensure that all communication between Auto Scaling components and other
    AWS services is encrypted using secure protocols like HTTPS.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Regularly Update AMIs
  description: Keep Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) used in Auto Scaling groups up to
    date with the latest security patches and updates.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enforce Instance Termination Protection
  description: Enable instance termination protection to prevent accidental or malicious
    termination of critical instances in Auto Scaling groups.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Security Groups and Network ACLs
  description: Configure security groups and network ACLs to control and restrict
    network traffic to and from instances in Auto Scaling groups.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Conduct Regular Security Audits
  description: Perform regular security audits of your Auto Scaling configurations
    and policies to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Implement Instance Metadata Protection
  description: Protect instance metadata from unauthorized access by configuring IAM
    roles and instance metadata options appropriately.
  severity: Medium
