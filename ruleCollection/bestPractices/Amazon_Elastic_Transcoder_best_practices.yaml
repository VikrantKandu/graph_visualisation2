- best_practice: Use Appropriate Instance Types
  description: Select the right instance types based on your workload requirements
    to ensure optimal performance and cost-efficiency.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Auto Scaling
  description: Use auto-scaling to automatically adjust the number of instances in
    response to demand, ensuring availability and cost management.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Utilize Elastic Load Balancing
  description: Distribute incoming application traffic across multiple instances to
    ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Optimize Storage Solutions
  description: Choose the appropriate storage solutions (e.g., S3, EBS) based on access
    patterns and performance needs.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Caching Mechanisms
  description: Implement caching strategies (e.g., CloudFront, ElastiCache) to reduce
    latency and improve user experience.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Monitor and Log Performance
  description: Use AWS CloudWatch and other monitoring tools to track performance
    metrics and log events for troubleshooting and optimization.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Design for Fault Tolerance
  description: Architect your application to handle failures gracefully by using multiple
    Availability Zones and redundancy strategies.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement CI/CD Pipelines
  description: Use continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines to automate
    the deployment process, ensuring consistency and reducing manual errors.
  severity: Medium
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Enable Encryption
  description: Use encryption for data at rest and in transit to protect sensitive
    information from unauthorized access.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Implement IAM Best Practices
  description: Follow AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) best practices, such
    as least privilege access, to secure your resources.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Use Security Groups and Network ACLs
  description: Configure security groups and network access control lists (ACLs) to
    control inbound and outbound traffic to your instances.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Regularly Rotate Access Keys
  description: Periodically rotate access keys and use IAM roles instead of long-term
    access keys to enhance security.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
  description: Require multi-factor authentication for all IAM users to add an additional
    layer of security.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Conduct Regular Security Audits
  description: Perform regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify
    and mitigate potential security risks.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use VPC for Network Isolation
  description: Deploy your resources within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to isolate
    them from other networks and enhance security.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable Logging and Monitoring
  description: Enable AWS CloudTrail and other logging services to monitor API activity
    and detect suspicious behavior.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Apply Security Patches Regularly
  description: Keep your instances and applications up-to-date with the latest security
    patches to protect against vulnerabilities.
