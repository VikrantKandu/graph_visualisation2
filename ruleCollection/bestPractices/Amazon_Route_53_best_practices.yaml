architecture_best_practices:
- best_practice: Use Multiple Availability Zones
  description: Distribute resources across multiple Availability Zones to ensure high
    availability and fault tolerance.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Implement Health Checks
  description: Configure health checks to monitor the health of your endpoints and
    automatically route traffic to healthy instances.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Weighted Routing for Load Balancing
  description: Distribute traffic across multiple resources by assigning weights,
    enabling efficient load balancing.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Enable DNS Failover
  description: Configure DNS failover to automatically route traffic to a backup site
    in case the primary site becomes unavailable.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Utilize Latency-Based Routing
  description: Route traffic to the AWS region that provides the lowest latency for
    your users, improving performance.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Leverage Geolocation Routing
  description: Direct users to endpoints based on their geographic location to comply with local regulations and improve user experience.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Implement Simple Routing for Single Resources
  description: Use simple routing when you have a single resource that handles all
    traffic, ensuring straightforward DNS management.
  severity: Low
- best_practice: Use Traffic Flow for Complex Routing Policies
  description: Utilize Route 53 Traffic Flow to create complex routing policies using
    a visual editor, simplifying management of complex configurations.
  severity: Medium
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Enable DNSSEC
  description: Enable Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) to protect against
    DNS spoofing and ensure the integrity of DNS responses.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Restrict Access to Route 53 Resources
  description: Use IAM policies to restrict access to Route 53 resources to only those
    users and roles that need it, minimizing the risk of unauthorized changes.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable Logging
  description: Enable logging for Route 53 to monitor and audit DNS queries, helping
    detect and investigate security incidents.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use MFA for Route 53 Management
  description: Require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for users managing Route
    53 to add an extra layer of security.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Regularly Review and Update Policies
  description: Regularly review and update IAM policies and security configurations
    to ensure they meet current security standards and requirements.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Monitor for Unusual Activity
  description: Set up monitoring and alerts for unusual activity in Route 53 to quickly
    detect and respond to potential security threats.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Private Hosted Zones for Internal DNS
  description: Use private hosted zones for internal DNS resolution within your VPCs
    to prevent exposure of internal DNS records to the public internet.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Implement Least Privilege Principle
  description: Grant the minimum necessary permissions to users and applications managing
    Route 53 to reduce the risk of accidental or malicious changes.
  severity: High
