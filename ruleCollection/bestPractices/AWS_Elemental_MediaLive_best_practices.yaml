architecture_best_practices:
- best_practice: Use Auto Scaling for EC2 Instances
  description: Implement Auto Scaling to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances
    based on demand. This ensures that your application can handle varying loads efficiently.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Multi-AZ Deployments
  description: Deploy your instances across multiple Availability Zones to enhance
    availability and fault tolerance. This helps in minimizing the impact of a single
    point of failure.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Optimize Instance Types
  description: Select the appropriate EC2 instance types based on your workload requirements
    to achieve cost efficiency and optimal performance.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
  description: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances using ELB to
    ensure high availability and reliability.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
  description: Use tools like AWS CloudFormation or Terraform to manage your infrastructure
    as code, enabling version control and automated deployments.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Enable Detailed Monitoring
  description: Activate detailed monitoring for your EC2 instances to gather more
    granular performance data for better insights and troubleshooting.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Amazon EBS-Optimized Instances
  description: For applications requiring high I/O performance, use EBS-optimized
    instances to ensure dedicated throughput between EC2 and EBS.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Implement Backup and Recovery Plans
  description: Regularly back up your data and have a robust recovery plan in place
    to prevent data loss in case of failures.
  severity: Critical
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Enable VPC Security Groups
  description: Use VPC security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to
    your instances, ensuring only authorized traffic is allowed.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement IAM Roles and Policies
  description: Use IAM roles and policies to manage access to your EC2 instances,
    ensuring that users and applications have the minimum required permissions.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
  description: Require MFA for accessing the AWS Management Console to add an extra
    layer of security.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Regularly Rotate Access Keys
  description: Regularly rotate access keys for IAM users to minimize the risk of
    compromised credentials.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Encrypt Data at Rest and in Transit
  description: Use encryption to protect your data both at rest and in transit, ensuring
    that sensitive information is secure.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Regularly Patch and Update Instances
  description: Keep your EC2 instances up to date with the latest security patches
    and updates to protect against vulnerabilities.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Monitor and Log Activity
  description: Use AWS CloudTrail and Amazon CloudWatch to monitor and log activity
    on your EC2 instances, enabling you to detect and respond to security incidents.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Network ACLs
  description: Use network ACLs in your VPC to provide an additional layer of security
    by controlling traffic to and from your subnets.
  severity: Medium
