    traffic to your RDS instances.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Regularly Patch and Update
  description: Ensure that your RDS instances are regularly patched and updated to
    protect against known vulnerabilities.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable Database Auditing
  description: Use AWS CloudTrail and RDS database auditing features to monitor and
    log database activities for security and compliance purposes.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Limit Public Accessibility
  description: Avoid making your RDS instances publicly accessible to reduce the attack
    surface and potential exposure to threats.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Use Security Best Practices for Applications
