architecture_best_practices:
- best_practice: Use Multi-AZ Deployments
  description: Ensure that your AWS services are deployed across multiple Availability
    Zones to enhance fault tolerance and availability.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Implement Auto Scaling
  description: Use Auto Scaling to automatically adjust capacity to maintain steady,
    predictable performance at the lowest possible cost.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Leverage AWS Managed Services
  description: Utilize AWS managed services like RDS, DynamoDB, and ECS to offload
    operational overhead and improve reliability.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Design for Failure
  description: Architect your systems with the assumption that individual components
    can fail, and ensure your system can recover gracefully.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Use Elastic Load Balancing
  description: Distribute incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such
    as EC2 instances, to increase fault tolerance.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Optimize for Cost Efficiency
  description: Regularly review your architecture to identify and eliminate underutilized
    resources and optimize for cost savings.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Implement Caching
  description: Use caching mechanisms like Amazon ElastiCache to reduce latency and
    improve application performance.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Monitor and Log
  description: Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging using AWS CloudWatch
    and CloudTrail to gain insights into system performance and issues.
  severity: High
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
  description: Require MFA for all users to add an extra layer of security to your
    AWS accounts.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Implement Least Privilege Access
  description: Grant users and services the minimum level of access necessary to perform
    their functions to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Encrypt Data at Rest and in Transit
  description: Use AWS KMS and SSL/TLS to encrypt sensitive data both at rest and
    in transit to protect it from unauthorized access.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Regularly Rotate Credentials
  description: Regularly rotate IAM credentials, API keys, and other secrets to minimize
    the risk of compromised credentials.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Security Groups and NACLs
  description: Implement security groups and network ACLs to control inbound and outbound
    traffic to your AWS resources.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Conduct Regular Security Audits
  description: Perform regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify
    and address potential security risks.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Enable AWS Config
  description: Use AWS Config to continuously monitor and record your AWS resource
    configurations and automate compliance checks.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Implement DDoS Protection
  description: Use AWS Shield and AWS WAF to protect your applications from Distributed
    Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
  severity: High
