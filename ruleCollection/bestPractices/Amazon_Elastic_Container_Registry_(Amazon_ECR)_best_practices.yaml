architecture_best_practices:
- best_practice: Use Regional Replication for High Availability
  description: Enable cross-region replication to ensure that your container images
    are available in multiple regions, reducing the risk of downtime.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Lifecycle Policies
  description: Use lifecycle policies to automatically delete old or unused images,
    helping to manage storage costs and maintain a clean repository.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Optimize Image Size
  description: Keep your container images as small as possible to reduce the time
    and resources needed for image pulls and deployments.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Tags for Versioning
  description: Implement a tagging strategy to manage different versions of your container
    images, making it easier to roll back to previous versions if needed.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Integrate with CI/CD Pipelines
  description: Integrate Amazon ECR with your Continuous Integration and Continuous
    Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Monitor and Log ECR Usage
  description: Use Amazon CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail to monitor and log activities
    in Amazon ECR, ensuring you have visibility into repository usage and access patterns.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Multi-Account Strategy
  description: Use a multi-account strategy to isolate different environments (e.g.,
    development, staging, production) for better resource management and security.
  severity: High
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Enable Encryption at Rest
  description: Ensure that your container images are encrypted at rest using AWS Key
    Management Service (KMS) to protect sensitive data.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Use IAM Policies for Access Control
  description: Implement fine-grained IAM policies to control who can access and perform
    actions on your Amazon ECR repositories.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Enable Image Scanning
  description: Enable image scanning to automatically check for vulnerabilities in
    your container images, helping to identify and remediate security issues.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Least Privilege Principle
  description: Grant the minimum permissions necessary for users and services to interact
    with Amazon ECR, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Use Private Repositories
  description: Store your container images in private repositories to restrict access
    and prevent unauthorized downloads.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Rotate Credentials Regularly
  description: Regularly rotate access keys and other credentials used to authenticate
    to Amazon ECR to minimize the risk of credential compromise.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
  description: Require MFA for users accessing Amazon ECR to add an additional layer
    of security.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Regularly Audit and Review Access Logs
  description: Periodically audit and review access logs to detect any unusual or
    unauthorized activities in your Amazon ECR repositories.
  severity: High
