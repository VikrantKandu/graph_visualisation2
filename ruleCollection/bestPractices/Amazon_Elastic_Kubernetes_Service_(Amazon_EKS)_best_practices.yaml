  severity: High
- best_practice: Utilize Multi-AZ Deployments
  description: Distribute EKS nodes across multiple Availability Zones to enhance
    fault tolerance and availability.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Optimize Resource Requests and Limits
  description: Set appropriate resource requests and limits for your pods to ensure
    efficient resource utilization and prevent resource contention.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Employ Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
  description: Use tools like AWS CloudFormation or Terraform to define and manage
    your EKS infrastructure as code for consistency and repeatability.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Monitor and Log Cluster Activity
  description: Implement monitoring and logging solutions such as Amazon CloudWatch
    and AWS CloudTrail to track and analyze cluster performance and activity.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Amazon EFS for Persistent Storage
  description: Use Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) for persistent storage needs to
    ensure high availability and scalability of storage resources.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Implement Network Policies
  description: Use Kubernetes Network Policies to control the communication between
    pods and enhance network security.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Regularly Update Kubernetes Version
  description: Keep your EKS clusters updated with the latest Kubernetes version to
    benefit from new features, performance improvements, and security patches.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Fargate for Serverless Deployments
  description: Utilize AWS Fargate for running EKS pods without managing the underlying
    infrastructure, simplifying operations and scaling.
  severity: Medium
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Enable IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)
  description: Use IAM roles for service accounts to grant fine-grained permissions
    to pods, reducing the risk of over-privileged permissions.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Implement Pod Security Policies
  description: Define and enforce pod security policies to control the security context
    of pods and mitigate security risks.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Secrets Management
  description: Store and manage sensitive information using AWS Secrets Manager or
    Kubernetes secrets, ensuring they are encrypted and access-controlled.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Enable Encryption for Data at Rest
  description: Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to encrypt EKS data at rest, including
    etcd and EBS volumes, to protect sensitive information.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Restrict API Server Access
  description: Limit access to the Kubernetes API server using network policies, security
    groups, and IAM policies to reduce the attack surface.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Regularly Rotate IAM Credentials
  description: Implement regular rotation of IAM credentials, including access keys
    and tokens, to minimize the risk of credential compromise.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Read-Only Root Filesystem
  description: Configure pods to use a read-only root filesystem to prevent unauthorized
    changes to the filesystem and enhance security.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Enable Audit Logging
  description: Enable Kubernetes audit logging to capture detailed records of API
    requests and responses, aiding in security monitoring and incident response.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Network Segmentation
  description: Use VPC, subnets, and security groups to segment the network and isolate
    different components of the EKS cluster, enhancing security.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Conduct Regular Security Assessments
  description: Perform regular security assessments, including vulnerability scanning
    and penetration testing, to identify and mitigate potential security risks.
  severity: High
