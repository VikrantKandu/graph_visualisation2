architecture_best_practices:
  - best_practice: Use Blue/Green Deployments
    description: Implement Blue/Green deployments to minimize downtime and reduce the
      risk of deployment failures by shifting traffic between two identical environments.
    severity: High
  - best_practice: Leverage Auto Scaling
    description: Integrate AWS CodeDeploy with Auto Scaling to automatically adjust
      the number of instances in response to traffic, ensuring high availability and
      performance.
    severity: Medium
  - best_practice: Use Deployment Groups
    description: Organize instances into deployment groups to manage deployments more
      effectively and target specific environments or subsets of instances.
    severity: Medium
  - best_practice: Monitor Deployments with CloudWatch
    description: Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor deployment metrics and set up alarms
      to detect and respond to issues promptly.
    severity: High
  - best_practice: Automate Rollbacks
    description: Configure automatic rollbacks to revert to the last known good state
      if a deployment fails, minimizing downtime and service disruption.
    severity: High
  - best_practice: Use Tags for Resource Management
    description: Tag resources to organize and manage deployments, enabling easier tracking
      and cost management.
    severity: Low
  - best_practice: Implement Canary Deployments
    description: Gradually roll out changes to a small subset of users before a full-scale
      deployment to catch issues early.
    severity: Medium

security_best_practices:
  - best_practice: Use IAM Roles and Policies
    description: Define and assign IAM roles and policies to control access to AWS CodeDeploy,
      ensuring that only authorized users can perform deployment actions.
    severity: Critical
  - best_practice: Enable Encryption
    description: Use encryption for data in transit and at rest to protect sensitive
      information during the deployment process.
    severity: High
  - best_practice: Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
    description: Require MFA for accessing AWS CodeDeploy to add an extra layer of security
      beyond just usernames and passwords.
    severity: High
  - best_practice: Regularly Rotate Access Keys
    description: Rotate AWS access keys periodically to reduce the risk of keys being
      compromised.
    severity: Medium
  - best_practice: Use VPC Endpoints
    description: Use VPC endpoints to securely connect to AWS CodeDeploy without exposing
      traffic to the public internet.
    severity: Medium
  - best_practice: Enable Logging and Auditing
    description: Enable AWS CloudTrail and other logging services to audit and monitor
      deployment activities, helping detect and respond to suspicious actions.
    severity: High
  - best_practice: Apply Least Privilege Principle
    description: Grant the minimum level of access necessary for users and services
      to perform their tasks, reducing the risk of unauthorized actions.
    severity: Critical
  - best_practice: Regular Security Assessments
    description: Conduct regular security assessments and vulnerability scans to identify
      and mitigate potential security risks.
    severity: Medium
