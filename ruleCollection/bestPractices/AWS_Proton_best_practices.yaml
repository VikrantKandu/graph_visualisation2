architecture_best_practices:
- best_practice: Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
  description: Implement AWS Proton with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to ensure consistent
    and repeatable deployments. This practice helps in managing and provisioning infrastructure
    through code rather than manual processes.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Modularize Templates
  description: Create modular and reusable templates in AWS Proton to promote scalability
    and maintainability. This allows for easier updates and management of resources.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Implement Version Control
  description: Use version control for your AWS Proton templates to track changes
    and enable rollbacks if necessary. This practice helps in maintaining the integrity
    of your infrastructure.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Optimize Resource Allocation
  description: Ensure that your AWS Proton templates are optimized for resource allocation
    to avoid over-provisioning or under-provisioning, which can lead to cost inefficiencies
    and performance issues.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Regularly Update Templates
  description: Keep your AWS Proton templates updated with the latest best practices
    and AWS features to ensure optimal performance and security.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Parameter Store for Configuration
  description: Utilize AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store for managing configuration
    data in AWS Proton templates. This practice helps in centralizing and securing
    configuration data.
  severity: Medium
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Implement Least Privilege Access
  description: Ensure that IAM roles and policies used in AWS Proton follow the principle
    of least privilege, granting only the necessary permissions required for tasks.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Enable Encryption
  description: Use encryption for data at rest and in transit within AWS Proton to
    protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Use AWS Secrets Manager
  description: Store and manage sensitive information such as API keys and database
    credentials in AWS Secrets Manager rather than hardcoding them in AWS Proton templates.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Regularly Rotate Secrets
  description: Implement a regular rotation policy for secrets managed by AWS Secrets
    Manager to minimize the risk of compromised credentials.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Monitor and Audit
  description: Enable logging and monitoring for AWS Proton using AWS CloudTrail and
    AWS Config to track changes and detect suspicious activities.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Apply Security Patches
  description: Regularly apply security patches to the underlying infrastructure managed
    by AWS Proton to protect against known vulnerabilities.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Network Security Controls
  description: Use security groups, network ACLs, and VPC configurations to control
    network traffic and protect resources managed by AWS Proton.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Conduct Regular Security Reviews
  description: Perform regular security assessments and reviews of your AWS Proton
    configurations to ensure compliance with security best practices and standards.
  severity: Medium
