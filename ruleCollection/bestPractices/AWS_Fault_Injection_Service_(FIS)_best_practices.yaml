architecture_best_practices:
- best_practice: Use Multi-AZ Deployments
  description: Ensure that your AWS RDS instances are deployed across multiple availability
    zones to enhance fault tolerance and availability.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Enable Automated Backups
  description: Configure automated backups to regularly back up your RDS instances,
    ensuring that you can restore your data in case of failure.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Optimize Instance Types
  description: Choose the appropriate instance type based on your workload requirements
    to ensure optimal performance and cost-efficiency.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Read Replicas
  description: Implement read replicas to offload read traffic from the primary database,
    improving performance and scalability.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Implement Database Monitoring
  description: Use Amazon CloudWatch and other monitoring tools to continuously monitor
    the health and performance of your RDS instances.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable Performance Insights
  description: Activate Performance Insights to gain deeper insights into database
    performance and identify bottlenecks.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Parameter Groups
  description: Configure parameter groups to manage database settings and optimize
    performance.
  severity: Low
- best_practice: Regularly Perform Maintenance
  description: Schedule and perform regular maintenance tasks, such as patching and
    updates, to keep your RDS instances secure and up-to-date.
  severity: Medium
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Enable Encryption
  description: Use AWS KMS to encrypt your RDS instances and snapshots to protect
    data at rest.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Implement IAM Roles
  description: Use IAM roles to manage access to your RDS instances, ensuring that
    only authorized users and applications can access your databases.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Security Groups
  description: Configure security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to
    your RDS instances, minimizing the attack surface.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable SSL/TLS
  description: Use SSL/TLS to encrypt data in transit between your application and
    RDS instances, protecting against man-in-the-middle attacks.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Regularly Rotate Credentials
  description: Regularly rotate database credentials and IAM keys to reduce the risk
    of compromised access.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Database Auditing
  description: Enable database auditing to track and log database activities, helping
    to detect and respond to suspicious actions.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use VPC Endpoints
  description: Use VPC endpoints to securely connect to your RDS instances without
    traversing the public internet.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Apply Least Privilege Principle
  description: Grant the minimum necessary permissions to users and applications accessing
    your RDS instances to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
  severity: High
