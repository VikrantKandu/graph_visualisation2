architecture_best_practices:
- best_practice: Use Multiple Availability Zones
  description: Deploy resources across multiple Availability Zones to ensure high
    availability and fault tolerance.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Implement VPC Peering
  description: Use VPC peering to enable communication between VPCs without traversing
    the public internet, ensuring low latency and high security.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Utilize Elastic IP Addresses
  description: Assign Elastic IP addresses to ensure consistent and reliable access
    to your instances, even if the underlying instance fails.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Leverage Route Tables
  description: Use route tables to control the flow of traffic within your VPC and
    to external networks, ensuring proper routing and network segmentation.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Subnet Segmentation
  description: Divide your VPC into multiple subnets to isolate different types of
    resources and control traffic flow.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)
  description: Implement NACLs to provide an additional layer of security at the subnet
    level, controlling inbound and outbound traffic.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Optimize IP Address Allocation
  description: Plan and allocate IP address ranges efficiently to avoid conflicts and ensure scalability.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Enable Flow Logs
  description: Enable VPC Flow Logs to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC, aiding in troubleshooting and security analysis.
  severity: Medium
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Use Security Groups
  description: Implement security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to
    your instances, ensuring only authorized traffic is allowed.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Enable Encryption
  description: Encrypt data in transit and at rest to protect sensitive information
    from unauthorized access.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Implement IAM Policies
  description: Use IAM policies to enforce the principle of least privilege, ensuring
    users and services have only the permissions they need.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Regularly Rotate Credentials
  description: Regularly rotate access keys, passwords, and other credentials to minimize
    the risk of compromised credentials.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Monitor and Audit Activity
  description: Use AWS CloudTrail and other monitoring tools to track and audit activity
    within your VPC for security and compliance purposes.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Restrict Public Access
  description: Minimize the exposure of your resources by restricting public access
    and using private endpoints whenever possible.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Implement DDoS Protection
  description: Use AWS Shield and other DDoS protection services to safeguard your
    VPC from distributed denial-of-service attacks.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Bastion Hosts
  description: Deploy bastion hosts to securely manage access to instances in private
    subnets, reducing the attack surface.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Regular Security Reviews
  description: Conduct regular security reviews and vulnerability assessments to identify
    and mitigate potential security risks.
  severity: High
