architecture_best_practices:
- best_practice: Use Multi-AZ Deployments
  description: Ensure that your AWS RDS instances are deployed across multiple availability
    zones to enhance fault tolerance and high availability.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Enable Automated Backups
  description: Configure automated backups for your RDS instances to ensure data recovery
    in case of accidental deletion or corruption.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Optimize Instance Types
  description: Select the appropriate instance types based on your workload requirements
    to balance performance and cost.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Read Replicas
  description: Implement read replicas to offload read traffic from the primary instance
    and improve read scalability.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Database Caching
  description: Use caching mechanisms such as Amazon ElastiCache to reduce latency
    and improve application performance.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Regularly Monitor Performance Metrics
  description: Continuously monitor performance metrics using Amazon CloudWatch to
    identify and address performance bottlenecks.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Parameter Groups
  description: Customize database parameters using parameter groups to optimize database
    performance and behavior.
  severity: Low
- best_practice: Enable Enhanced Monitoring
  description: Enable enhanced monitoring for deeper insights into database performance
    and resource utilization.
  severity: Medium
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Enable Encryption at Rest
  description: Ensure that your RDS instances use encryption at rest to protect sensitive
    data from unauthorized access.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Use IAM Roles for Access Control
  description: Implement IAM roles to manage access to your RDS instances and minimize
    the use of hardcoded credentials.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable Encryption in Transit
  description: Use SSL/TLS to encrypt data in transit between your application and
    RDS instances to prevent data interception.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Regularly Rotate Credentials
  description: Regularly rotate database credentials to reduce the risk of unauthorized
    access due to compromised credentials.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Security Groups
  description: Use security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to your
    RDS instances, limiting access to only trusted sources.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Enable Database Auditing
  description: Enable database auditing to track and log database activities for compliance
    and security monitoring.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Apply Least Privilege Principle
  description: Grant the minimum necessary permissions to users and applications to
    reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Regularly Apply Security Patches
  description: Keep your RDS instances up to date with the latest security patches
    to protect against known vulnerabilities.
  severity: High
