    description: Enable AWS CloudTrail and Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor access and usage of Amazon FSx, helping to detect and respond to security incidents.
    severity: High
  - best_practice: Regularly Rotate Access Keys
    description: Regularly rotate access keys and credentials to minimize the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials.
    severity: High
  - best_practice: Implement Network Segmentation
    description: Use security groups and network ACLs to segment and isolate Amazon FSx resources within your VPC, reducing the attack surface.
    severity: Medium
  - best_practice: Conduct Regular Security Audits
    description: Regularly audit your Amazon FSx configurations and access controls to ensure compliance with security best practices and regulatory requirements.
    severity: Medium
