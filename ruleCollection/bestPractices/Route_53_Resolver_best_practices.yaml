architecture_best_practices:
- best_practice: Use Private Hosted Zones for Internal DNS
  description: Utilize Private Hosted Zones to manage DNS within your VPCs to ensure
    internal DNS resolution is isolated from public DNS queries.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable DNS Query Logging
  description: Enable query logging to monitor and troubleshoot DNS queries, helping
    to identify and resolve issues quickly.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Implement Multi-Region Architectures
  description: Design your DNS architecture to span multiple AWS regions to ensure
    high availability and fault tolerance.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Use Conditional Forwarding
  description: Configure conditional forwarding rules to direct DNS queries to specific
    DNS resolvers based on the domain name, optimizing query resolution.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Optimize Resolver Endpoints
  description: Strategically place Route 53 Resolver endpoints in your VPCs to reduce
    latency and improve DNS resolution performance.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Regularly Review and Update DNS Records
  description: Periodically audit and update DNS records to ensure they are accurate
    and up-to-date, avoiding potential resolution issues.
  severity: Medium
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Restrict Access to Resolver Endpoints
  description: Use security groups and network ACLs to control access to Route 53
    Resolver endpoints, ensuring only authorized entities can query DNS.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Implement VPC Peering and Transit Gateway
  description: Use VPC peering or Transit Gateway to securely connect multiple VPCs,
    ensuring secure DNS resolution across your network.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable DNSSEC for Domain Validation
  description: Enable DNSSEC to protect against DNS spoofing and ensure the authenticity
    of DNS responses.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Use IAM Policies to Control Access
  description: Implement fine-grained IAM policies to control who can create, modify,
    and delete DNS records and Resolver endpoints.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Monitor and Alert on DNS Activity
  description: Set up monitoring and alerting for unusual DNS activity to quickly
    detect and respond to potential security incidents.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Regularly Update Resolver Rules
  description: Regularly review and update Resolver rules to ensure they align with
    current security policies and organizational changes.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Encrypt DNS Traffic
  description: Use DNS over HTTPS (DoH) or DNS over TLS (DoT) to encrypt DNS queries,
    protecting them from interception and tampering.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Audit DNS Query Logs
  description: Regularly audit DNS query logs to identify and investigate any suspicious
    or unauthorized DNS queries.
  severity: Medium
