    severity: High
  - best_practice: Optimize Network Configuration
    description: Ensure that your network configuration, including bandwidth and latency, is optimized for the type of data transfer you expect to perform with AWS Storage Gateway.
    severity: High
  - best_practice: Implement Data Compression
    description: Use data compression to reduce the amount of data transferred between your on-premises environment and AWS, thereby saving on bandwidth and storage costs.
    severity: Medium
  - best_practice: Regularly Monitor Performance Metrics
    description: Continuously monitor performance metrics such as throughput, latency, and error rates to identify and address any issues promptly.
    severity: Medium
  - best_practice: Plan for Scalability
    description: Design your AWS Storage Gateway setup to easily scale with your growing data needs, ensuring that it can handle increased loads without performance degradation.
    severity: Medium
  - best_practice: Use Multiple Gateways for High Availability
    description: Deploy multiple Storage Gateways in different locations or availability zones to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
    severity: Critical
  - best_practice: Integrate with AWS Backup
    description: Use AWS Backup to automate and manage backups of your data stored in AWS Storage Gateway, ensuring data durability and compliance.
    severity: High

security_best_practices:
  - best_practice: Enable Encryption at Rest
    description: Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to enable encryption at rest for all data stored in AWS Storage Gateway to protect sensitive information.
    severity: Critical
  - best_practice: Use Secure Access Controls
    description: Implement IAM roles and policies to restrict access to AWS Storage Gateway resources, ensuring that only authorized users and applications can access your data.
    severity: Critical

    description: Use SSL/TLS to encrypt data in transit between your on-premises environment and AWS Storage Gateway to prevent data interception.
    severity: Critical
  - best_practice: Regularly Rotate Encryption Keys
    description: Regularly rotate encryption keys used for data encryption to minimize the risk of key compromise.
    severity: High
  - best_practice: Enable Logging and Monitoring
    description: Enable AWS CloudTrail and Amazon CloudWatch to log and monitor all access and activity related to AWS Storage Gateway, helping to detect and respond to security incidents.
    severity: High
  - best_practice: Conduct Regular Security Audits
    description: Perform regular security audits and assessments of your AWS Storage Gateway setup to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
    severity: High
  - best_practice: Implement Network Segmentation
    description: Use VPCs, subnets, and security groups to segment your network and limit access to AWS Storage Gateway, reducing the attack surface.
    severity: Medium
  - best_practice: Apply Patches and Updates
    description: Regularly apply patches and updates to your AWS Storage Gateway software to protect against known vulnerabilities and exploits.
    severity: Medium
