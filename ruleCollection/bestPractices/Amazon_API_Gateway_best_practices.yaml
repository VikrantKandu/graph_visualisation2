architecture_best_practices:
- best_practice: Use Stages for Different Environments
  description: Separate your API Gateway configurations into different stages (e.g.,
    development, staging, production) to isolate changes and ensure stability in production.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Enable Caching for API Responses
  description: Utilize API Gateway caching to improve performance and reduce backend
    load by storing responses for a specified period.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Throttling and Rate Limiting
  description: Set up throttling and rate limiting to control the number of requests
    your API can handle, protecting backend services from being overwhelmed.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Custom Domain Names
  description: Configure custom domain names for your APIs to provide a consistent
    and professional endpoint for clients.
  severity: Low
- best_practice: Optimize Integration with AWS Lambda
  description: Ensure that your API Gateway is optimally configured to integrate with
    AWS Lambda, including setting appropriate timeouts and error handling.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Monitor and Log API Activity
  description: Enable CloudWatch logging and monitoring to track API usage, performance,
    and errors for better operational insights.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use API Gateway Models and Mapping Templates
  description: Define models and use mapping templates to validate and transform request
    and response payloads, ensuring data integrity.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Leverage Multi-Region Deployments
  description: Deploy your API Gateway in multiple regions to enhance availability
    and reduce latency for global users.
  severity: Medium
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Enable API Gateway Access Logging
  description: Configure access logging to capture detailed information about each
    API request, aiding in security auditing and troubleshooting.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use IAM Roles for Secure Access
  description: Assign IAM roles to control access to API Gateway, ensuring that only
    authorized entities can invoke your APIs.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Implement API Key Validation
  description: Use API keys to manage and control access to your APIs, allowing you
    to track and limit usage by different clients.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable WAF for API Protection
  description: Integrate AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) with API Gateway to protect
    against common web exploits and attacks.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Use Mutual TLS for API Authentication
  description: Enforce mutual TLS to authenticate client requests, adding an additional
    layer of security to your APIs.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Encrypt Data in Transit and at Rest
  description: Ensure that all data transmitted to and from API Gateway is encrypted
    using HTTPS, and use AWS KMS to encrypt sensitive data at rest.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Validate Request Payloads
  description: Use request validation to ensure that incoming requests meet expected
    formats and constraints, reducing the risk of injection attacks.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Set Up Alarms for Security Incidents
  description: Configure CloudWatch alarms to alert you to potential security incidents,
    such as spikes in request rates or unauthorized access attempts.
  severity: High
