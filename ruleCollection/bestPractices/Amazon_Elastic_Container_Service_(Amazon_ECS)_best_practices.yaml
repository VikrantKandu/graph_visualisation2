architecture_best_practices:
- best_practice: Use Auto Scaling for ECS Services
  description: Implement Auto Scaling to automatically adjust the number of ECS tasks
    in response to changes in demand, ensuring optimal resource utilization and application
    availability.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Service Discovery
  description: Use AWS Cloud Map or ECS Service Discovery to enable your ECS tasks
    to discover and connect with each other dynamically, facilitating easier management
    of microservices.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Leverage Task Definitions
  description: Define your ECS tasks using task definitions to specify container configurations,
    resource requirements, and networking settings, ensuring consistency and repeatability.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Optimize Task Placement Strategies
  description: Use task placement strategies and constraints to control how tasks
    are distributed across your cluster, improving resource utilization and fault
    tolerance.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Multiple Availability Zones
  description: Deploy ECS services across multiple Availability Zones to enhance fault
    tolerance and availability, reducing the impact of zone-specific failures.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Monitor and Log ECS Services
  description: Implement monitoring and logging using Amazon CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray
    to gain insights into ECS service performance and troubleshoot issues effectively.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Fargate for Serverless Containers
  description: Consider using AWS Fargate to run containers without managing the underlying
    EC2 instances, simplifying operations and improving scalability.
  severity: Medium
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Implement IAM Roles and Policies
  description: Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and policies to
    control access to ECS resources, ensuring that only authorized entities can perform
    specific actions.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Enable Encryption for Sensitive Data
  description: Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to encrypt sensitive data at rest
    and in transit, protecting it from unauthorized access.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Security Groups and Network ACLs
  description: Configure security groups and network ACLs to control inbound and outbound
    traffic to your ECS tasks, reducing the attack surface.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Regularly Update Container Images
  description: Keep your container images up to date with the latest security patches
    and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Private Container Registries
  description: Store container images in private repositories such as Amazon ECR to
    restrict access and prevent unauthorized usage.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Implement Least Privilege Principle
  description: Grant the minimum necessary permissions to ECS tasks, IAM roles, and
    users to reduce the risk of privilege escalation and unauthorized access.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Enable Logging and Auditing
  description: Enable logging and auditing for ECS tasks and services to track access
    and changes, helping to detect and respond to security incidents.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Secrets Management
  description: Use AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to securely
    manage and retrieve sensitive information like database credentials and API keys.
  severity: High
