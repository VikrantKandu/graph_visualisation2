architecture_best_practices:
- best_practice: Use Multi-AZ for High Availability
  description: Ensure that your AWS DMS replication instances are deployed in a Multi-AZ
    configuration to provide high availability and failover support.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Optimize Source and Target Endpoints
  description: Properly configure and optimize both source and target database endpoints
    to ensure efficient data migration and minimal downtime.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Appropriate Instance Types
  description: Select the appropriate instance types for your replication tasks based
    on workload requirements to ensure optimal performance and cost-efficiency.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Monitor and Scale Resources
  description: Continuously monitor replication tasks and scale resources as needed
    to handle varying loads and ensure consistent performance.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Leverage Pre-Validation and Post-Validation
  description: Use pre-validation and post-validation checks to ensure data integrity
    and consistency before and after migration.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Task Settings for Performance Tuning
  description: Fine-tune task settings such as memory allocation, parallelism, and
    logging to optimize the performance of your migration tasks.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Plan for Downtime and Maintenance
  description: Schedule migrations during maintenance windows to minimize the impact
    on production systems and ensure a smooth transition.
  severity: Low
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Enable Encryption at Rest
  description: Ensure that data at rest is encrypted using AWS Key Management Service
    (KMS) to protect sensitive information.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Use Secure Network Connections
  description: Configure secure network connections (e.g., SSL/TLS) for data in transit
    between the source, target, and replication instances.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Implement IAM Policies and Roles
  description: Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies and roles to
    control access to AWS DMS resources and ensure least privilege access.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable Logging and Monitoring
  description: Enable AWS CloudTrail and Amazon CloudWatch logging and monitoring
    to track activities and detect any unauthorized access or anomalies.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Regularly Update and Patch
  description: Keep your replication instances and database endpoints updated with
    the latest patches and updates to mitigate security vulnerabilities.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use VPC Endpoints
  description: Use VPC endpoints to privately connect your replication instances to
    other AWS services without exposing them to the public internet.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Conduct Regular Security Audits
  description: Perform regular security audits and assessments to identify and address
    potential security risks and compliance issues.
  severity: Medium
