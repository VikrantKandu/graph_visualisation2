architecture_best_practices:
- best_practice: Use Appropriate Cluster Size
  description: Ensure the DAX cluster size is appropriate for your workload to avoid
    under-provisioning or over-provisioning, which can affect performance and cost.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable Multi-AZ Clusters
  description: Use Multi-AZ clusters for high availability and fault tolerance to
    ensure your application can withstand failures in a single Availability Zone.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Monitor Cluster Metrics
  description: Regularly monitor DAX cluster metrics such as CPU utilization, memory
    usage, and request latency to identify and address performance bottlenecks.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Node Types Based on Workload
  description: Select node types that match your workload requirements to ensure optimal
    performance and cost-efficiency.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Optimize Item Size
  description: Keep item sizes small to improve performance and reduce latency, as
    larger items can lead to higher read and write times.
  severity: Medium
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Enable Encryption at Rest
  description: Enable encryption at rest to protect sensitive data stored in DAX from
    unauthorized access.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Use IAM Policies for Access Control
  description: Implement fine-grained IAM policies to control access to DAX clusters,
    ensuring that only authorized users and applications can interact with the service.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable VPC Endpoints
  description: Use VPC endpoints to securely connect to DAX clusters without exposing
    them to the public internet, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Regularly Rotate Credentials
  description: Regularly rotate IAM credentials and access keys to minimize the risk
    of compromised credentials being used maliciously.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Implement Network Segmentation
  description: Use network segmentation to isolate DAX clusters from other parts of
    your network, limiting the potential attack surface.
  severity: Medium
