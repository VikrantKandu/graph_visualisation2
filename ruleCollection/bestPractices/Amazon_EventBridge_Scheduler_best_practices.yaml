architecture_best_practices:
- best_practice: Use EventBridge Rules for Event Filtering
  description: Leverage EventBridge rules to filter and route events to the appropriate
    targets, reducing unnecessary processing and improving efficiency.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Design for High Availability
  description: Ensure that your EventBridge setup is distributed across multiple Availability
    Zones to prevent single points of failure.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Implement Idempotency
  description: Design your event consumers to handle duplicate events gracefully,
    ensuring that processing the same event multiple times does not cause issues.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Dead Letter Queues (DLQs)
  description: Configure DLQs for your EventBridge rules to capture and analyze failed
    event deliveries, helping to identify and resolve issues.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Monitor EventBridge Metrics
  description: Regularly monitor EventBridge metrics such as Invocations, FailedInvocations,
    and Throttles to ensure the health and performance of your event-driven architecture.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Optimize Event Size
  description: Keep event payloads small to reduce latency and cost, and to ensure
    that events are processed quickly.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Event Replay for Debugging
  description: Utilize EventBridge's event replay feature to troubleshoot and debug
    issues by replaying events that were previously processed.
  severity: Low
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Implement Least Privilege Access
  description: Ensure that IAM roles and policies grant only the minimum permissions
    necessary for EventBridge operations to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Enable CloudTrail Logging
  description: Enable AWS CloudTrail to log all API calls made to EventBridge, providing
    an audit trail for security and compliance purposes.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Encryption for Sensitive Data
  description: Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest using AWS Key Management
    Service (KMS) to protect it from unauthorized access.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Regularly Rotate IAM Credentials
  description: Rotate IAM credentials and access keys regularly to minimize the risk
    of compromised credentials.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Network Security Controls
  description: Use VPC endpoints and security groups to control network access to
    EventBridge, ensuring that only authorized sources can send events.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Conduct Regular Security Audits
  description: Perform regular security audits and assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in your EventBridge setup.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use AWS Config Rules
  description: Use AWS Config rules to ensure compliance with your organization's security policies and best practices for EventBridge.
  severity: Medium
