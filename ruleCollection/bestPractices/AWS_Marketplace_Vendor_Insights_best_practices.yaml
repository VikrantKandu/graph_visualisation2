architecture_best_practices:
- best_practice: Use Multi-AZ Deployments
  description: Ensure that your AWS services are deployed across multiple Availability
    Zones (AZs) to enhance fault tolerance and availability.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Implement Auto Scaling
  description: Utilize Auto Scaling to automatically adjust capacity to maintain steady,
    predictable performance at the lowest possible cost.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Optimize Resource Utilization
  description: Regularly review and optimize the use of AWS resources to avoid over-provisioning
    and underutilization.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Managed Services
  description: Leverage AWS managed services to reduce the operational overhead and
    complexity of managing infrastructure.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Implement Caching Mechanisms
  description: Use caching services like Amazon ElastiCache to reduce latency and
    improve application performance.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Design for Scalability
  description: Architect your applications to scale horizontally to handle increased
    load by adding more instances rather than increasing the size of existing instances.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
  description: Employ IaC tools like AWS CloudFormation or Terraform to automate the
    provisioning and management of your AWS infrastructure.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Regularly Review Architecture
  description: Conduct regular architecture reviews to ensure that your design aligns
    with best practices and evolving requirements.
  severity: Medium
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
  description: Require MFA for all user accounts to add an extra layer of security
    beyond just usernames and passwords.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Roles
  description: Assign IAM roles to AWS resources instead of using access keys to enhance
    security and manage permissions more effectively.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Network Segmentation
  description: Use Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and subnets to segment your network
    and control traffic flow to enhance security.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable Logging and Monitoring
  description: Use AWS CloudTrail, Amazon CloudWatch, and AWS Config to monitor, log,
    and audit activities in your AWS environment.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Encrypt Data at Rest and in Transit
  description: Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to encrypt sensitive data both
    at rest and in transit to protect against unauthorized access.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Regularly Update and Patch Systems
  description: Ensure that all systems and applications are regularly updated and
    patched to protect against known vulnerabilities.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Conduct Regular Security Audits
  description: Perform regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify
    and mitigate potential security risks.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Least Privilege Principle
  description: Grant users and applications the minimum level of access necessary
    to perform their functions to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
  severity: Critical
