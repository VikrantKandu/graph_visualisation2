    of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable Logging and Monitoring
  description: Enable AWS CloudTrail and Amazon CloudWatch to log and monitor access
    to your schemas, providing visibility into usage patterns and potential security
    incidents.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Conduct Regular Security Audits
  description: Perform regular security audits and assessments to identify and remediate
    potential vulnerabilities in your schema registry setup.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Secure Network Configurations
  description: Implement secure network configurations, such as VPC endpoints and
    security groups, to control and restrict network access to your schema registry.
