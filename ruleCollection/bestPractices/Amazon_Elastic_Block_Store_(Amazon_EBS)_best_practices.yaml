architecture_best_practices:
- best_practice: Use Provisioned IOPS for High-Performance Applications
  description: For applications requiring high and consistent I/O performance, use
    EBS volumes with Provisioned IOPS to ensure stable and predictable performance.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Regularly Snapshot EBS Volumes
  description: Take regular snapshots of your EBS volumes to ensure data durability
    and facilitate data recovery in case of failure or data corruption.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Optimize Volume Type Based on Workload
  description: Choose the appropriate EBS volume type (e.g., General Purpose SSD,
    Provisioned IOPS SSD, Throughput Optimized HDD) based on your workload requirements
    to balance cost and performance.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use EBS-Optimized Instances
  description: Use EBS-optimized instances to ensure dedicated bandwidth between your
    EC2 instances and EBS volumes, reducing latency and improving performance.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Monitor EBS Performance Metrics
  description: Use CloudWatch to monitor EBS performance metrics such as IOPS, throughput,
    and latency to identify and address performance bottlenecks.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Implement Multi-AZ Architectures
  description: Design your architecture to use multiple Availability Zones to improve
    fault tolerance and availability, ensuring that your application can withstand
    the failure of a single AZ.
  severity: Critical
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Encrypt EBS Volumes
  description: Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to encrypt EBS volumes to protect
    sensitive data at rest and ensure compliance with security standards.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Implement IAM Policies for Access Control
  description: Use Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to control and restrict
    access to EBS volumes, ensuring that only authorized users and services can access
    your data.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable EBS Volume Encryption by Default
  description: Configure your AWS account to automatically encrypt all new EBS volumes
    to ensure consistent security practices across your environment.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Regularly Rotate Encryption Keys
  description: Regularly rotate your encryption keys to reduce the risk of key compromise
    and ensure the ongoing security of your encrypted data.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use CloudTrail for Auditing
  description: Enable AWS CloudTrail to log all API calls related to EBS volumes,
    providing an audit trail for security analysis and compliance purposes.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Data Lifecycle Management
  description: Use EBS Lifecycle Manager to automate the creation, retention, and
    deletion of snapshots to ensure data is managed securely and efficiently.
  severity: Medium
