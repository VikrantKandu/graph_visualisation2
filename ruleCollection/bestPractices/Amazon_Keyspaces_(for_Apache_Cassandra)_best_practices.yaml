architecture_best_practices:
- best_practice: Proper Data Modeling
  description: Design your tables and queries to match your access patterns. This
    ensures efficient data retrieval and storage, minimizing latency and cost.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Partition Keys Effectively
  description: Choose partition keys that evenly distribute data across partitions
    to avoid hotspots and ensure consistent performance.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Optimize Read and Write Consistency Levels
  description: Configure consistency levels based on your application's requirements
    to balance between performance and data accuracy.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Monitor and Scale Appropriately
  description: Regularly monitor your Amazon Keyspaces usage and performance metrics,
    and scale your resources to meet demand.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Implement Caching Strategies
  description: Use caching mechanisms like Amazon ElastiCache to reduce the load on
    Amazon Keyspaces and improve read performance.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Time-to-Live (TTL) for Data Expiry
  description: Set TTL for data that has a limited lifespan to automatically delete
    it, saving storage costs and keeping your dataset manageable.
  severity: Low
- best_practice: Leverage AWS Global Accelerator
  description: Use AWS Global Accelerator to improve the availability and performance
    of your applications with Amazon Keyspaces.
  severity: Low
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Enable Encryption at Rest
  description: Use AWS KMS to encrypt data stored in Amazon Keyspaces to protect it
    from unauthorized access.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Use IAM Policies for Access Control
  description: Define fine-grained IAM policies to restrict access to Amazon Keyspaces
    resources based on the principle of least privilege.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Enable VPC Endpoints
  description: Use VPC endpoints to securely connect to Amazon Keyspaces without exposing
    your traffic to the public internet.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable Encryption in Transit
  description: Use TLS to encrypt data in transit between your application and Amazon
    Keyspaces to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Regularly Rotate Credentials
  description: Rotate IAM credentials and database access keys regularly to minimize
    the risk of compromised access.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Monitor and Audit Access
  description: Use AWS CloudTrail and Amazon CloudWatch to monitor and audit access
    to Amazon Keyspaces, ensuring compliance and detecting suspicious activities.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Implement Network Segmentation
  description: Use security groups and network ACLs to segment your network and restrict
    access to Amazon Keyspaces based on your security requirements.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
  description: Require MFA for IAM users to add an extra layer of security to your
    Amazon Keyspaces resources.
  severity: Medium
