architecture_best_practices:
- best_practice: Use Multi-Region Keys
  description: Ensure that keys are available in multiple regions to provide high
    availability and disaster recovery capabilities.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable Key Rotation
  description: Automatically rotate keys to limit the amount of data encrypted with
    a single key, reducing the risk of data exposure.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Aliases for Key Management
  description: Use aliases to manage keys more easily and avoid hardcoding key IDs
    in applications.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Separate Keys by Application and Environment
  description: Use different keys for different applications and environments (e.g.,
    development, testing, production) to minimize the impact of key compromise.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Leverage AWS CloudFormation for Key Management
  description: Use AWS CloudFormation to automate the creation and management of keys,
    ensuring consistent and repeatable deployments.
  severity: Medium
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Implement Least Privilege Access
  description: Grant the minimum level of access necessary for users and applications
    to perform their tasks, reducing the risk of unauthorized key usage.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Enable Key Policies and IAM Policies
  description: Use key policies and IAM policies to control access to keys, ensuring
    that only authorized entities can use them.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Monitor Key Usage with AWS CloudTrail
  description: Enable AWS CloudTrail to log and monitor all key usage activities,
    helping to detect and respond to unauthorized access.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
  description: Require MFA for key management operations to add an extra layer of
    security against unauthorized access.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Regularly Audit Key Permissions
  description: Periodically review and audit key permissions to ensure that they are
    still appropriate and follow the principle of least privilege.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Customer Managed Keys (CMKs) for Sensitive Data
  description: Use CMKs for encrypting sensitive data to have more control over key
    management and access policies.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable Key Deletion Protection
  description: Enable deletion protection for keys to prevent accidental or unauthorized
    deletion of keys.
  severity: Medium
