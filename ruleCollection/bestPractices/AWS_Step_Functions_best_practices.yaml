architecture_best_practices:
- best_practice: Use State Machine Versioning
  description: Implement versioning for your state machines to ensure you can roll
    back to previous versions if issues arise.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Optimize State Machine Execution
  description: Design your state machines to minimize execution time and resource
    usage by using parallel states and reducing the number of transitions.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Modular State Machine Design
  description: Break down complex workflows into smaller, reusable state machines
    to improve maintainability and scalability.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Error Handling and Retries
  description: Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms to ensure your
    workflows can recover from transient failures.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Monitor and Log State Machine Executions
  description: Enable detailed logging and monitoring to track the performance and
    health of your state machines.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Optimize State Machine Costs
  description: Design your state machines to minimize costs by using fewer states
    and optimizing the execution duration.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Appropriate State Types
  description: Select the most suitable state types (e.g., Task, Choice, Parallel)
    for your workflow to ensure efficiency and clarity.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Implement Idempotency
  description: Ensure that your state machine executions are idempotent to avoid duplicate
    processing and potential data inconsistencies.
  severity: High
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Use IAM Roles for State Machine Permissions
  description: Assign the least privilege IAM roles to your state machines to limit
    access to only the necessary resources.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Encrypt Sensitive Data
  description: Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to encrypt sensitive data passing
    through your state machines.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Enable Logging and Auditing
  description: Enable AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch Logs to audit and monitor state
    machine executions for security and compliance purposes.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Secure State Machine Endpoints
  description: Use VPC endpoints to secure communication between your state machines
    and other AWS services.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Validate Input Data
  description: Implement input validation to ensure that only expected and safe data
    is processed by your state machines.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Resource Policies
  description: Apply resource policies to restrict access to your state machines and
    prevent unauthorized actions.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Regularly Review and Rotate Secrets
  description: Regularly review and rotate any secrets or credentials used by your
    state machines to minimize the risk of compromise.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Network Security Controls
  description: Use security groups and network ACLs to control traffic to and from
    your state machines.
  severity: Medium
