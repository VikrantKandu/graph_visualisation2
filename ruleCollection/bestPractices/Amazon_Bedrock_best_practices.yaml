- best_practice: Optimize Database Connections
  description: Use connection pooling and optimize the number of database connections
    to ensure efficient use of resources and avoid performance bottlenecks.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Read Replicas
  description: Use read replicas to offload read traffic from the primary database,
    improving performance and scalability.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Automated Backups
  description: Enable automated backups to ensure data recovery in case of accidental
    deletion or corruption.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Monitor Performance Metrics
  description: Continuously monitor performance metrics like CPU utilization, memory
    usage, and I/O operations to identify and address performance issues proactively.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Appropriate Instance Types
  description: Select instance types that match your workload requirements to ensure
    optimal performance and cost-efficiency.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Implement Database Indexing
  description: Use indexing to speed up query performance and reduce the load on the
    database.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable Multi-AZ for Read Replicas
  description: Deploy read replicas in multiple Availability Zones to enhance read
    availability and fault tolerance.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Parameter Groups
  description: Use parameter groups to manage and apply configuration settings consistently
    across your RDS instances.
  severity: Low
- best_practice: Regularly Update Database Engine
  description: Keep your database engine up to date with the latest patches and updates
    to ensure security and performance improvements.
  severity: High
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Enable Encryption at Rest
  description: Use AWS KMS to enable encryption at rest for your RDS instances to
    protect sensitive data.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Enable Encryption in Transit
  description: Use SSL/TLS to encrypt data in transit between your application and
    RDS instances to prevent data interception.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement IAM Roles
  description: Use IAM roles to manage permissions and access to your RDS instances,
    following the principle of least privilege.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Enable Enhanced Monitoring
  description: Use enhanced monitoring to gain deeper insights into the operating
    system metrics and performance of your RDS instances.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Security Groups
  description: Configure security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to
    your RDS instances, restricting access to only necessary IP addresses and ports.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable Database Auditing
  description: Use database auditing to track and log database activities, helping
    to detect and respond to suspicious activities.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Regularly Rotate Credentials
  description: Regularly rotate database credentials and IAM access keys to reduce
    the risk of compromised credentials.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
  description: Enable MFA for IAM users and roles that have access to RDS instances
    to add an extra layer of security.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Conduct Regular Security Assessments
  description: Perform regular security assessments and vulnerability scans to identify
    and mitigate potential security risks.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Implement Network Isolation
  description: Use VPCs, subnets, and network ACLs to isolate your RDS instances from
    other parts of your network, reducing the attack surface.
  severity: High
