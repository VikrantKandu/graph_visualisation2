  severity: High
- best_practice: Optimize for Cost
  description: Regularly review your resource usage and leverage AWS Cost Management
    tools to optimize your architecture for cost efficiency.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Use Managed Services
  description: Where possible, use AWS managed services like RDS, DynamoDB, and Lambda
    to reduce the operational overhead and improve reliability.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Caching
  description: Use caching mechanisms such as Amazon ElastiCache to reduce latency
    and improve application performance.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Design for Scalability
  description: Architect your applications to scale horizontally by adding more instances
    rather than scaling vertically by adding more power to a single instance.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Infrastructure as Code
  description: Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using tools like AWS CloudFormation
    or Terraform to automate the provisioning and management of your AWS resources.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Monitor and Log
  description: Use AWS CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail to monitor the performance and
    security of your applications and infrastructure.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Backup and Recovery
  description: Regularly back up your data and implement disaster recovery plans to
    ensure data integrity and availability.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Use Appropriate Instance Types
  description: Select the right EC2 instance types based on your workload requirements
    to optimize performance and cost.
  severity: Medium
security_best_practices:
- best_practice: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
  description: Use MFA for all AWS account users to add an extra layer of security.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Use IAM Roles
  description: Use IAM roles instead of IAM users to grant permissions to AWS resources,
    reducing the risk of credential leakage.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Implement Least Privilege Principle
  description: Grant only the permissions necessary for users and services to perform
    their tasks, minimizing potential security risks.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Encrypt Data at Rest and in Transit
  description: Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to encrypt sensitive data at rest
    and SSL/TLS to encrypt data in transit.
  severity: Critical
- best_practice: Regularly Rotate Credentials
  description: Regularly rotate IAM access keys and passwords to reduce the risk of
    compromised credentials.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use Security Groups and Network ACLs
  description: Implement Security Groups and Network ACLs to control inbound and outbound
    traffic to your AWS resources.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Enable AWS Config
  description: Use AWS Config to continuously monitor and record your AWS resource
    configurations and compliance.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Implement VPC Flow Logs
  description: Use VPC Flow Logs to capture information about the IP traffic going
    to and from network interfaces in your VPC.
  severity: Medium
- best_practice: Conduct Regular Security Audits
  description: Regularly audit your AWS environment for security vulnerabilities and
    compliance with best practices.
  severity: High
- best_practice: Use AWS WAF and Shield
  description: Implement AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) and AWS Shield to protect
    your web applications from common web exploits and DDoS attacks.
